// The world's own fingerprint, first recorded before the spatial index was
// wired into anything and rewritten whenever a rule deliberately changes.
//
// Rewritten on 2026-09-01, when inheritance stopped being the average of the
// parents, and again the same day when mutation became rare and large instead
// of a nudge on every birth (both stage 7b), and again when the genes started
// being paid for out of a budget (stage 7c), and again when memory became
// finite and resting in the open stopped being free (stage 9), and again when
// agents started being born small and growing into themselves (stage 7d), and
// again when bringing a carcass down together started being remembered (the
// remainder of stage 11), and again when a stranger stopped being worth the
// same flat prior to everybody (stage 10).
//
// Stage 7a is a change of how the neighbours are found, not of what happens,
// and its completion condition is that the same seed gives the same run. That
// cannot be checked by running two copies of the same binary against each other
// - both would be wrong together. It needs numbers from the world as it was, so
// here they are.
//
// These are also the numbers to look at when a later stage changes the rules on
// purpose: they will move, and the diff says by how much. Rewrite them when
// that happens, in the commit that changes the rule, and never to make a red
// test go green.
