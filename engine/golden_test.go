// The world's own fingerprint, recorded before the spatial index was wired into
// anything and asserted ever since.
//
// Stage 7a is a change of how the neighbours are found, not of what happens,
// and its completion condition is that the same seed gives the same run. That
// cannot be checked by running two copies of the same binary against each other
// - both would be wrong together. It needs numbers from the world as it was, so
// here they are.
//
// These are also the numbers to look at when a later stage changes the rules on
// purpose: they will move, and the diff says by how much. Rewrite them when
// that happens, in the commit that changes the rule, and never to make a red
// test go green.
